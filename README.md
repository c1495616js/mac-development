# Setup

Sometimes, you just want to get up-and-running with a new machine. This does
that (if you use Vim and happen to share all of my current preferences).

## MacOS

**Note:** If you have an existing `~/.vimrc` file, I would recommend making a
backup before following the instructions below.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/c1495616js/mac-development.git
$ cd mac-development && ./index.sh
```
